## Refactoring existing code to meet accessibility standards

A marketing agency wants a codebase that follows accessibility standards. This will ensure that the site is optimized for search engines.
I have replaced some non-semantic elements with semantic HTML elements.
I have ensured that HTML elements follow a logical structure.
I have added the accessible alt attribute to all images on the site.
